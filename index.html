<p>Hello there! This webpage is meant to document our progress on interfacing and using the Arduino Pilot Mega V2.5 with the Raspberry Pi. Before you attempt to try out the steps listed below, please take some time to study and practice Python as well as C++ programming since we will be needing it.</p>

<p>Project APM is a subset of the Under Water Robot Project. The main project is to [re]construct an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle(AUV). There are several groups of different disciplines working on this project and we are one of these groups(EEE). We are mainly in charge of the software aspects of the project.(Keyboard Warriors!) </p>  

<p>There are three people in the EEE group. Each of us have been assigned individual responsibilities as shown below: </p>  
 
<pre><code>Yong Boon ---> Compass & Depth Sensor
Wei Khang ----> Control Systems
Brian -----------> Computer Vision
</code></pre>  
 
<p>One of the AUVs.</p>

<a name="[1.1]-the-competition" class="anchor" href="#[1.1]-the-competition"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>[1.1] The Competition</h3>

<p>The Singapore AUV Challenge 2013 was the most recent competition that our AUV participated in. The project was passed down to us just after the competition.(We got fourth!) Our AUV did not manage to make it through the gate and the motion of the robot was also very choppy.</p> 
 
<p>The video of the competition can be found here: </p>

<p>Why do we need the Arduino Pilot Mega? Well, we need a compass sensor! If you saw that video above, you would know that our AUV turned around and went back the start point. This was because it did not have a sensor to read it's orientation.</p>

<p>No, no one is swimming. Only the Remotely Operated Vehicle(ROV) is swimming. Our supervisors brought us down to pool to demonstrate the ROV. Everyone from all the groups was present and we sure had fun.</p>
